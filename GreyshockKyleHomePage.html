    <h1>Mastering the Chess Basics: A Beginner's Chess Strategy Guide</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Why Chess Strategy Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Many new players focus on <span class="italictext">learning openings</span> and <span
            class="italictext">memorizing moves</span>. While that’s helpful and there are many
        resources online to help with this, <span class="boldtext">strategy</span> is what truly makes you a better
        player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Strategy helps you understand <span class="boldtext">why moves are made</span> and gives you a plan during the
        game, instead of just <span class="italictext">reacting</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>Control the Center</h3>
    <p>
        The center of the board (<span class="boldtext">e4, d4, e5, d5</span>) is the most powerful area. If you control
        it, your pieces have more
        options and influence. Opening principles like playing <span class="boldtext">e4</span> or <span
            class="boldtext">d4</span> aim to gain central control.
        Avoid pushing <span class="italictext">random pawns</span> on the edge of the board early.
    </p>

    <h3>Develop Your Pieces</h3>
    <p>
        Get your <span class="boldtext">knights and bishops</span> out quickly so they can support your center and
        prepare for castling.
        Don’t move the same piece multiple times in the opening unless you’re forced to.
        Development leads to <span class="italictext">better coordination</span> and <span class="italictext">board
            control</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
        One of the biggest beginner mistakes is bringing the <span class="boldtext">queen out too early</span>.
        While the queen is powerful, she can easily become a target, forcing you to waste moves retreating.
        Another mistake is <span class="boldtext">not castling early</span>, leaving your king exposed to attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, many new players forget to look at what their opponent is trying to do.
        They get caught up in their own plans and walk into traps.
        Always ask yourself: <span class="italictext">“What does my opponent want with that move?”</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Opening Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="boldtext">Move a central pawn</span> (e4 or d4)</li>
        <li><span class="boldtext">Develop your knights</span> before bishops</li>
        <li><span class="boldtext">Castle early</span> for king safety</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you're just starting out, take it <span class="italictext">one step at a time</span>.
        Ensure you are not leaving your pieces on <span class="boldtext">vulnerable squares</span>,
        and <span class="italictext">practice daily</span>.
        Most importantly, <span class="boldtext italictext">have fun playing!</span>
