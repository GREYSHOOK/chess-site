    <section>
        <p>This website was created to help beginner chess players build a solid foundation in strategy. Chess can be an
            intimidating game to learn, especially with so many complex terms and tactics. This site is meant to break
            down essential strategies into easy-to-understand concepts that players can start applying immediately.</p>

        <p>The inspiration for this project came from my own journey learning chess. I found that there weren't many
            resources that explained beginner strategies in a clear and approachable way. My goal is to fill that gap
            and offer practical advice that actually improves your game.</p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>My name is Kyle Greyshock. Iâ€™m in the Air Force and a passionate chess player. When I am
            not busy working or pursuing my degree, I spend my time studying chess
            tactics, playing games online, and helping others learn the game.</p>

        <p>Chess has taught me valuable lessons about patience, planning, and adapting to challenges. These kills also
            carry
            over into leadership and life. Thereofore, I have creates this website to help share this passion with
            others.
        <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope the content here helps you enjoy chess as much as I do!</p>
